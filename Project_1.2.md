# Project 1.2

In this project, I plotted two different sized trees and homes. This was to then map a path in which someone could travel between 7 of the 50 plotted houses. Instead of a straight line between the 7 randomly selected houses, I used a parabolic line to better illustrate the travel of a human. There are 12 large trees, 40 small trees, and 50 homes. All of the plotted points are randomly selected, so I am able to produce many different plots with the same code.  Here are just two different plots that were generated.
