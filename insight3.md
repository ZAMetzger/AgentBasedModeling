# Agent Based Modeling in Social Science

Agent based modeling is used frequently for quantitative studies, but could it also be used for social psychology? Eliot R. Smith and Frederica R. Conrey from Indiana University discuss in their piece, “Agent-Based Modeling: A New Approach for Theory Building in Social Psychology”, how agent-based modeling provides better observational models than variable based modeling, VBM. Social psychology is rarely the is the “result of isolated decisions by individuals, but rather as the result of repeated interactions between multiple individuals over time.” This makes social psychology a good match for agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling uses the collected data and autonomous agents to create a simulation of the environment and the predictions. This way social psychologists can actually map the many different interactions that are at play and make accurate predictions. Agent-based modeling was first used for social psychology in 1971 by Schelling. He ran a model that dealt with segregation and being the minority in a community. He was able to stimulate how with the mindset of “not being the minority” caused segregation. The model segregated itself. In 2005, Epstein said, in reference to Schelling’s model, “It’s important because—even though highly idealized—it offers a powerful and counter-intuitive insight.” Now agent-based modeling is finding its way into various forms of psychology. Relationship experts are attempting to use agent-based modeling to view relationships as outcomes of one’s cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and cultural characteristics that develop over their lifespan. There are many other’s using agent-based modeling for cross disciplinary research in order to provide the most wholistic approach to their data. They are able to make accurate predictions over a time frame about complex relationships. Ultimately the using of agent-based modeling in social sciences allows for more comprehensive models and estimates as explained by Smith and Conrey.
