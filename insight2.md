# The Quantified Self
The quantified self, QS, is the tracking and collection of biological, physical, behavioral, or environmental data by the user. Companies such as Apple and Fitbit use QS in their watch products. Their devices are tracking step counts, heart rates, etc., but their apps also encourage users to input data such as calories, water intake, mood, etc. Both of these collections of data are QS. This newer kind of data and data collection are very useful, informative, and challenging. According to Melanie Swan in her 2013 publication, The Quantified Self: Fundamental Disruption in Big Data Science and Biological Discovery, “60% of U.S. adults are currently tracking their weight, diet, or exercise routine, and 33% are monitoring other factors such as blood sugar, blood pressure, headaches, or sleep patterns. Further, 27% of U.S. Internet users track health data online, 9% have signed up for text message health alerts, and there are 40,000 smartphone health applications available.” QS is being used by a lot of people and it is only growing as technology improves and becomes more accessible. 

Due to the accessibility, more people are becoming interested in self-experimenting. Many people are tracking their diets, weight, and exercise to see if they lose weight. While others use it to track their glucose levels and heart rate for medical purposes. With all of these people collecting so much data, new challenges arise for Big Data. It is becoming increasingly hard to store, query, and manipulate QS data sets. Most of the QS data ends up being stored in the cloud. This means the individual has very little access to the data. Swan talks about how a potential solution to the storage and access of QS data sets would be to give individuals cloud-based services for their self-tracking data storage and leave some data on the device. 

Another issue is aggregating multiple data sets to find a connection between varying types of QS data. Data from different sources exist in different forms, for example, biometric, sound, images, textual, and GPS data. There are a few issues with this. Some services, such as Fitbit, only allow restricted access to their API instead of giving their users and Excel of CSV file. This means users have to pay to access some data. Someone with experience with data analyzation would still have to get through the challenge of finding an appropriate application. Those with little to no analysis skills or knowledge would have to go through an authorized third party to get an integration of their QS data.

Now some people may want to compare their data to others, so this means there would need to be some kind of repository for QS data. This brings the QS data to the world. It allows people to use the individual’s data on a larger scale. This can be helpful for people wanting to study the effectiveness of specific factors, such as diets and workouts. For people in the medical field, the repository could be used to identify preventative measures for various medical issues. 

Niamh Bermingham-McDonogh discusses the three common types of analysis for QS data: exploratory, principal component, correlation, regression. Exploratory analysis focuses on looking at means, modes, medians, etc. Usually the exploratory analysis is visualized using line plots, box plots, scatter plots, and bar plots. They highlight patterns and relationships in order to develop hypothesis’. Principle component analysis is statistical technique that reduces the number of dimensions of a dataset by transforming correlated variables to uncorrelated variables. Principle components allow the user to make their data more manageable. Also, the user can find relationships that would otherwise be hard to visualize. Correlation analysis is very useful when comparing different variables. This would be done with Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient or Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient. They determine weather there is linear correlation between two variables. Finally, regression analysis models the correlation between variables mathematically. 

In conclusion, QS data is a new and very accessible form of data collection that could provide very useful and important information, but it also creates a lot of challenges with storage and analysis. There is great potential for QS data and people interested in collecting and studying data on themselves. There needs to be a solution to data storage that allows users to analyze their data efficiently and effectively.
